# üì∞ News Data Extraction

Project of a robot responsible for extracting information from news on the [Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/) website and saving it in an Excel file.

The detailed information in the report will be:
- Title.
- Date.
- Description.
- Picture Filename.
- Occurrence of Search Phrase in Title and Description.
- Title and Description Have Monetary Value?
- News Image.

## üìã Prerequisites

Make sure you have the entire **environment configured** in **Robocorp**. If not, follow the steps recommended in the [Robocorp Documentation](https://robocorp.com/docs/courses/beginners-course-python/12-running-in-robocorp-cloud).

Furthermore, for the **robot** to **work**, a **work item must be provided** to it as input data.

The Work Item is a json that needs to have the following parameters:
- search_phrase.
- sort_by.
> Note that currently, there are only two types of sort_by available on the website: **date** and **relevance**.

Work Item Example:
```json
{
    "search_phrase": "Donald Trump",
    "sort_by": "Date"
}
```

> More information can be found at [Robocorp Work Items Documentation](https://rpaframework.org/libraries/robocorp_workitems/).
